    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this work is to use the California Census data to deliver a model predicting the median housing price based on the features contained within the census data set.  The model will be used as a sub-model in a larger model predicting investment opportunities for the company.  Given propogation of error, it is important to deliver an accurate model since its results will be used in a subsequent model.  Ultimately, the output of the this work will be the district median price signal that will be fed into the overall investment model.\n",
